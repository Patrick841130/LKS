# LKS COIN Mainnet Whitepaper

## Executive Summary

LKS COIN represents a revolutionary approach to blockchain infrastructure, combining the proven stability of XRPL's consensus mechanism with Solana's high-performance architecture to deliver a zero-fee, institutional-grade blockchain platform. With a target throughput of 65,000 transactions per second and sub-second finality, LKS COIN is designed to become the backbone of next-generation Web3 applications.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Vision
To create a blockchain infrastructure that eliminates transaction fees for users while maintaining institutional-grade security, compliance, and performance standards.

### 1.2 Mission
LKS COIN mainnet will serve as a global Web3 infrastructure leader, enabling seamless cross-chain interoperability and regulatory-compliant blockchain applications.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Hybrid Consensus Mechanism
- **Primary**: Proof of History (PoH) for transaction ordering
- **Secondary**: Proof of Stake (PoS) for block validation
- **Finality**: Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) for immediate finality
- **Block Time**: 400ms target with sub-second finality

### 2.2 Core Protocol Foundation
Built on XRPL's proven protocol with enhancements:
- Native tokenization without smart contracts
- Built-in decentralized exchange (DEX)
- Established institutional connections
- Regulatory compliance features

### 2.3 Smart Contract Layer
WebAssembly (WASM) Hooks written in Rust:
- Lightweight execution environment
- Direct ledger integration
- Gas-efficient operations
- Deterministic execution

## 3. LKS COIN Tokenomics

### 4.2 Zero-Fee Hook Implementation
```rust
// Simplified Rust Hook for zero-fee transactions
use hook_api_sdk_rs::{
    accept, reject, get_tx_type, trace_u64,
    otxn_type, otxn_slot, slot_set, S_FEE
};

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn hook() -> i64 {
    let tx_type = otxn_type();
    let lks_transfer_type = 1234;

    if tx_type == lks_transfer_type {
        let fee_slot = slot_set(S_FEE, 0);
        let mut fee_drops: u64 = 0;
        let result = otxn_slot(fee_slot, &mut fee_drops, 8);
        
        if result == 8 {
            slot_set(S_FEE, 0);
            trace_u64("Fee-exempt transaction processed.", 0);
            accept("Zero-fee transaction accepted.", 0);
        } else {
            reject("Failed to process transaction fee.", 0);
        }
        return 0;
    }
    
    reject("Hook does not handle this transaction type.", 0);
    return 0;
}
```

### 4.3 Native DEX Integration
```json
{
  "TransactionType": "OfferCreate",
  "Account": "rUSER_ACCOUNT_PUBKEY",

    "value": "100"
  },
  "TakerPays": {
