## **Phase 2: Production Deployment** 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### **Step 1: Domain & SSL Setup**
```bash
# Purchase domains
- lksnetwork.com (main explorer)
- admin.lksnetwork.com (admin dashboard)
- rpc.lksnetwork.com (RPC endpoint)
- api.lksnetwork.com (API gateway)

# SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt or commercial)
certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare \
  -d lksnetwork.com \
  -d admin.lksnetwork.com \
  -d rpc.lksnetwork.com \
  -d api.lksnetwork.com
```

### **Step 2: Cloud Infrastructure**
```bash
# AWS/GCP/Azure setup
# Recommended: AWS EKS or Google GKE

# Create production cluster
kubectl create namespace lks-production

# Deploy with Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/production/
```

### **Step 3: Database & Storage**
```bash
# Production Redis cluster
# MongoDB/PostgreSQL for persistent data
# S3/GCS for backups and static assets

# Configure persistent volumes
kubectl apply -f k8s/storage/
```
